            <h2 class="title" style="font-size: 1.75rem;">Available Servers</h2>

            <div class="content">
                <h3 class="subtitle">Server: private_loc</h3>
                <p>
                    The <strong style="color: #00adb5;">private_loc</strong> server stores locations that are only visible to you and the agents you specifically choose to share them with.
                    This server ensures that sensitive locations, such as personal hideouts or mission-critical assets, are kept completely private and accessible only by authorized personnel.
                </p>

                <h3 class="subtitle">Server: public_loc</h3>
                <p>
                    The <strong style="color: #00adb5;">public_loc</strong> server allows you to store and share locations with all agents.
                    This is ideal for collaborative missions where sharing information can benefit the entire network. By using public_loc, agents can identify common hideouts,
                    shared gear caches, or important meeting points that could enhance operational synergy and success.
                </p>

                <h3 class="subtitle">Additional Server Requests</h3>
                <p>
                    Need a server for mission-specific purposes? QuickR-Maps admins can set up additional, custom servers tailored to your mission's needs.
                    Whether itâ€™s for a temporary operation, specialized data segregation, or regional focus, just contact the admins to request a new server.
